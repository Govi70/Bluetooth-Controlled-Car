# 🚗 Bluetooth Controlled Car (IoT Project)

This is a simple Arduino-based **Bluetooth controlled car** project.  
The car is controlled wirelessly via a smartphone using an HC-05 Bluetooth module and Arduino Uno.  

---

## 📌 Features
- Control the car using your phone over Bluetooth.
- Commands:  
  - `F` → Move Forward  
  - `B` → Move Backward  
  - `L` → Turn Left  
  - `R` → Turn Right  
  - `S` → Stop  

---

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors (x4) + Car chassis
- Battery (9V/12V)
- Jumper wires
